# Flight-Reservations
The website allows users to book a flight with live seating options. Users can also check the status of their current and previous bookings
Every time a user searches for a flight; random flights, flight times and prices will appear. Taxes are calculated based on a final price. The website also contains deals of the day section and some other functions. The administrator can access all booked flights and keep track of monthly, annually and total sales since ahsan airline  started. All information is shown to the administrator in a visual graph format. Once administrator approves the ticket, the status will change from pending to confirmed. CSS, bootstrap, and HTML were utilized to design the website. Tomcat web server is used to run JSP and all user information is saved in MySQL database. Java and javascript are primary languages I use to add different functionalities to my website. Also, I use various libraries like JQuery. Ajax was also used to get live data from the database.
