# Flight-Reservations
Website allows users to Book a flight with live seating options. Users can also check the status of their current and previous bookings
Everytime a user search for a flight random flights, flight time and price appears. Taxes are calculated based on final price. Website
also contain deals of the day section and some other functions.
Administrator can access all booked flights and keep track of monthly, annually and total sale sinceahsan  airline airline started.All
information is shown to administrator in a visually graph format. Once adminstrator approve ticket, status will change from pending to
confirmed. CSS, bootstrap and HTML were utilized to design the website. Tomcat web server is used to run JSP and all user information is
saved in MySQL database. Java and javascript are primary languages I use to add different functionalities to my website. In addition,
I use various libriaries like JQuery. Ajax was also used to get live data from database.
